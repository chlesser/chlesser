### Hello!

My name is Charles Lesser, and I'm an undergraduate research assistant at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is my third year there, and I am studying computer science, with a focus in game design.

#### Developer 
I am proficient with the Unity engine, and write scripts in C#, C++, C, Javascript, Java, and Python. I have worked with the Unreal and Twine engines in the past as well. I have worked extensively with VR, AR, and multiplayer environments.

#### Free Time
When I'm not working on or playing a video game, I can often be found preparing or playing in one of my D&D sessions! To get active, I play water polo year round, and ski in the colder seasons. 

#### Opportunities
I'm currently looking for opportunities in game design and development, including internships and contract work. Reach me by [email](mailto:clesser@ucsc.edu) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesser).
