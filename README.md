### Hello!

My name is Charles Lesser, and I'm an undergraduate research assistant at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is my second year there, and I am studying computer science, with a focus in game design.

#### Developer
In terms of development, I am proficient with the Unity engine, and can write script in C#, C++, C, Javascript, Java, and Python. I have worked with the Unreal and Twine engines in the past as well (If I am required to write in Assembly, I can, but I will silently resent you). I have worked extensively with Mixed Reality and Multi-user environments.

#### Free Time
When I'm not working on or playing a video game, I can often be found preparing or playing in one of my D&D sessions! To get active, I play water polo year round, and ski in the colder seasons. I'm also in the gym most days, though I listen to the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. If the water is clear, I like to get out and scuba dive.

#### Opportunities
I'm currently looking for opportunities in game design and development, including internships and contract work. Reach me by [email](mailto:clesser@ucsc.edu) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesser).
